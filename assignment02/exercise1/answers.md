### Exercise 1(b)

For n = 1,000,000 I measured the wall time of my axpy implementation 50 times in a single program run and saw that the runtimes were not constant but fluctuated between a minimum of about 0.00077 s and a maximum of about 0.00179 s, with an average of about 0.00128 s. Similar behaviour appeared for n = 500,000. These differences happen because the operating system schedules other processes, the CPU frequency and cache state can change, and memory access is not always exactly the same, especially in the first few “cold” runs. A single measurement can therefore be misleading, so I use the average runtime over all 50 repetitions as one trustworthy value, since this reduces the influence of random noise and better represents the typical performance of the axpy function.
