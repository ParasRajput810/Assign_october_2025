For Exercise 2.b, we evaluated the polynomial \(P(x)=x^6-998x^5-998x^4-998x^3-998x^2-998x-998\) at \(x=1\) and \(x=999\) using two equivalent implementations: direct evaluation of \(\sum\_{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i\) (`eval_poly`) and Horner’s scheme (`eval_horner`). The results were identical at \(x=1\) (`eval_poly = -5987`, `eval_horner = -5987`), but differed at \(x=999\) (`eval_poly = 0`, `eval_horner = 1`, difference \(=-1\)). This happens because the direct method forms very large intermediate values (e.g., terms with \(999^6\)), and floating‑point arithmetic cannot represent all numbers exactly, so rounding and cancellation errors accumulate; Horner’s method evaluates the polynomial in a nested form, avoids explicit high powers, and typically reduces the size of intermediate values, making it more numerically stable for large \(|x|\). In conclusion, Horner’s method should be preferred for large \(|x|\) and higher-degree polynomials because it is generally more numerically stable.
